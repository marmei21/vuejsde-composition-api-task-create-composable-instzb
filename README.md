# Vuejs.de - Composition API - Task: Create your first composable

Build a composition function which implements the following logic:

1. An intial value can be applied (true/false)
2. A function which toggles that value
3. A function which can be used to set the value to a specific state

Use that function for all 3 use cases inside MyExample.vue.
Use an extra file for that function and import it inside the component.
